# SentryHUD

This is just a highly modified ToonHUD built to my liking, and for a more competitive player than the base ToonHUD gives. If you find any bugs then contact me, or create an issue on [the issues page](https://github.com/BingBongBonky/SentryHud/issues) of this repository.

To install the HUD, just drag the folder "sentryhud" into your tf/custom folder, or copy + paste it in.
