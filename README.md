# SentryHUD

This is just a highly modified ToonHUD built to my liking, and for a more competitive player than the base ToonHUD gives. If you find any bugs then contact me, or create an issue on [the issues page](https://github.com/BingBongBonky/SentryHud/issues/new) of this repository.

## Installation

1. Press `Download ZIP` on Github. This will download `SentryHud-release.zip`
2. Navigate to `[Drive Letter]:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`
3. Extract the .zip file contents into the `custom` folder.
4. Ensure that the final file structure should resembles the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── sentryhud
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        └── info.vdf
